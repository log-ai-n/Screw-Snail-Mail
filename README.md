## Tips for Better OCR

| Tip | Reason |
|-----|--------|
| Use bright, even lighting; avoid shadows | Tesseract accuracy drops with low contrast |
| Fill the camera frame; keep page square | Bigger text = fewer recognition errors |
| For glossy letters: tilt slightly to dodge glare | Prevents blown-out highlights |
| Use iPhone Continuity Camera as "webcam" if available | Sharper sensor for better results |

## Camera Setup and Testing

Before using the main application, you may want to verify that your camera is properly configured and accessible. A test script is provided for this purpose:

```bash
python camera_test.py
```

This utility will:
1. Scan for all available cameras on your system (including iPhone Continuity Camera)
2. Let you select which camera to use
3. Test if your selected webcam can be accessed
4. Display your camera feed in a window if successful
5. Provide troubleshooting steps specific to your operating system if unsuccessful

### Using iPhone as a Camera (Continuity Camera)

The application fully supports using your iPhone as a high-quality camera via Apple's Continuity Camera feature:

1. Make sure your iPhone and Mac are on the same Apple ID and have Bluetooth and WiFi enabled
2. Enable Continuity Camera on your iPhone: Settings ‚Üí General ‚Üí AirPlay & Handoff ‚Üí Continuity Camera
3. Position your iPhone so it can see your desk (using a stand or holder is recommended)
4. Run the application from the project directory (so Info.plist is found)
5. When the camera selection prompt appears, choose your iPhone from the list

**Advantages of using iPhone camera**:
- Much higher resolution and better image quality
- Stronger autofocus capabilities
- Better performance in low light conditions
- Increased OCR accuracy due to superior optics

### Camera Permissions

For the application to work, you need to grant camera access to Terminal (or your code editor):

- **Windows**: Settings ‚Üí Privacy ‚Üí Camera ‚Üí ensure your terminal or editor is allowed
- **Linux**: Permissions vary by distribution (see camera_test.py for details)

**Important**: After granting permission, you may need to restart your terminal or code editor.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Camera black / permission denied | Run `python camera_test.py` to diagnose and fix camera permission issues |
| Many wrong characters (e.g., "0" vs "O") | Increase light, reshoot closer, or adjust threshold in ocr() function |
| TesseractNotFoundError | Open new terminal after `brew install tesseract` so PATH refreshes |
| Gemini quota exceeded | Summarize locally or upgrade API quota |
| "OpenCV: camera failed to properly initialize" | After granting camera permissions, restart your terminal or code editor |
